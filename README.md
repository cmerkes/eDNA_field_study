# Code to assist the USFWS with eDNA field sampling designs for eDNA


Richard A. Erickson, Christopher M. Merkes, and Erica L. Mize

<!-- This code supports the manuscript "Sampling designs for landscape-level eDNA monitoring programs using three-level occurrence models.  -->
<!-- Specifically, we used this code to examine different sampling methods for eDNA-based studies as well as the ability of a three-level occupancy model to recover parameters. Our code can be used to conduct power analysis of eDNA-based studies or analyzed eDNA-based models with a three-level occupancy model.  -->
<!-- (Both of these uses would require some adaption by the user and require the user understand the statistical assumptions of occupancy models, experimental design, the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) languages, and eDNA-based studies). -->
